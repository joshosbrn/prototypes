Hi! This is where I keep all of my web prototypes. You might find straight-up HTML/JS stuff in here, Framer prototypes, all kinds of wild shit. If we're working on a prototype together (at NPR or otherwise) go ahead and clone this repo. If I haven't given you push access, just let me know via Slack and I'll get you set up. 

All Framer prototypes should work in the most recent release of Framer (currently v68). If you find that's not the case, please let me know and I'll update it.

Have fun!!! °˖✧ \ (⁰▿⁰) / ✧˖°
